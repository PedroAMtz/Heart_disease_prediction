# Heart Disease Prediction
The goal of this repository itÂ´s to show some best practices when working with structured data, trying to build efficient functions for data preprocessing, exploration and visualization.

**Particular objectives**

* Understand and apply pandas methods and functions to explore data.
* Using different visualization libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.
* Explore keras and tensroflow neural networks model for classification.
* Apply different classification metrics in order to fully understand the capacity and performance of the model to train.
* Use MLFlow for experiment tracking.
